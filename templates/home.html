                        These days, I’m living in New York City with my partner and our dog&#x1F415. When I’m not working as a technical project manager & financial advisor, I’m typically learning as much as I can about data analytics and policy at Johns Hopkins University. Otherwise, you can find me listening to music (<a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3pnzymgHgFEbD18XfmxOKY?si=4bcb03b159e04418">here are my favorite songs from 2021</a>), playing games, eating too much&#x1F9C0, or traveling (albeit not as much lately).

                        In summer 2020, I co-founded <a href="https://creatingforjustice.org" target="_blank">Creating for Justice</a> (CFJ), an all-volunteer, 501(c)(3) organization. CFJ offers accessible, competitive educational opportunities in the performing arts, fine arts, business skills, and health counseling.&#x1F3A8 Volunteers provide these services in exchange for donations that benefit anti-racist organizations.<br>
                        <br>That winter, I applied and earned acceptance to Johns Hopkins’s MS in Data Analytics and Policy program. My expected graduation is fall 2022!

                    I transferred to New York City (&#x1F44D) in the middle of winter (&#x1F44E) for my job at JPMorgan. That fall, I made my way to FinTech, where I’ve since received my Project Management Professional (PMP) Certification and Series 65 Financial Advisor License.

                    I was fortunate to attend college right after high school. In fall 2009, I began my undergraduate career at Iowa State University, where I got a BA in Advertising with a Minor in Psychology.<br>
