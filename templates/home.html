  <h1>Presently I'm...</h1>
  <p>Wearing a lot of hats. :) I live in New York City üèôÔ∏è with my partner and my dog. I like extracting actionable insights from data, listening to music, playing games, and traveling the world.
<br>
<br>
Currently, I'm a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University üè´, pursuing my MS in Data Analytics and Policy. As the amount of data available to us accumulates exponentially, I believe we have a responsibility to use it responsibly to make he world a better place. Take a look around my repositories to see what I have been up to while in in school. üëÄ
<br>
<br>
By day, I am a Technical Project Manager and licensed Financial Advisor at a FinTech company offering digital banking solutions to not-for-profit credit unions.</p>
