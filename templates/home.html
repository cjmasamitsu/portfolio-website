                        I live in NYC with my partner and our dog and currently work as a Director at The New York Times. When I'm not working, you can find me listening to music (<a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1j6RAgnI3eCdoBCNwwxSdp?si=40252765fd6b423c", target="blank">here are my favorite songs so far this year</a>), playing games, seeing an opera or musical, reading, cooking (then eating too much&#x1F9C0), or traveling around the world.

I'm working as the Director of Subscription Revenue, Risk, and Compliance at The New York Times. In this role, I lead technical cross-functional initiatives to build and scale enterprise-wide controls. These controls ensure the business is able to nimbly navigate the increasingly complex regulatory landscape. Grounded in my master's in Data Analytics & Policy from Johns Hopkins, I drive strategic decisions that protect revenue and ensure user trust.

                        In summer 2020, I co-founded <a href="https://creatingforjustice.org" target="_blank">Creating for Justice</a> (CFJ), an all-volunteer, 501(c)(3) organization. CFJ offers accessible, competitive educational opportunities in the performing arts, fine arts, business skills, and health counseling.&#x1F3A8 Volunteers provide these services in exchange for donations that benefit anti-racist organizations.<br>
                        <br>That winter, I applied and earned acceptance to Johns Hopkins’s MS in Data Analytics and Policy program.

                    I transferred to New York City (&#x1F44D) in the middle of winter (&#x1F44E) for my job at JPMorgan. That fall, I made my way to FinTech, where I’ve since received my Project Management Professional (PMP) Certification and Series 65 Financial Advisor License.

                    I was fortunate to attend college right after high school. In fall 2009, I began my undergraduate career at Iowa State University, where I got a BA in Advertising with a Minor in Psychology.<br>

                    In 2009, I graduated from Ogden High School, where I ran cross country, played golf, and completed every math course available—eventually taking more at the nearby community college as an upperclassman.&#x1F4CA
