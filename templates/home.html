                        These days, I’m living in New York City with my partner and our dog. When I’m not working as a technical project manager x financial advisor, I’m typically learning as much as I can about data analytics and policy at Johns Hopkins University. Otherwise, you can find me listening to music, playing games, or traveling (albeit not as much lately).

                                working full-time as a technical project manager and financial advisor in FinTech. More specifically, I design and implement digital banking solutions for credit unions and other not-for-profit financial institutions.

                    In summer 2020, I co-founded Creating for Justice (CFJ), an all-volunteer, 501(c)(3) organization. CFJ offers accessible, competitive educational opportunities in the performing arts, fine arts, business skills, and health counseling. Volunteers provide these services in exchange for donations that benefit anti-racist organizations.<br>
                        <br>That winter, I applied and earned acceptance to Johns Hopkins’s MS in Data Analytics and Policy program. My expected graduation is fall 2022!

                    I transferred to New York City (yay!) in the middle of winter (yikes) for my job at JPMorgan. That fall, I made my way to FinTech, where I’ve since received my Project Management Professional (PMP) Certification and Series 65 Financial Advisor License.

                    I was fortunate to attend college right after high school. In fall 2009, I began my undergraduate career at Iowa State University, where I got a BA in Advertising with a Minor in Advertising.<br>
                        <br><i>Fun fact: I spent junior year at Texas State University as part of a national exchange program, which first introduced me to life near Austin!</i>

                    In 2009, I graduated from Ogden High School, where I ran cross country, played golf, and completed every math course available—eventually taking more at the nearby community college as an upperclassman.

                        I was born in Ames, Iowa, in the late summer of 1990. The third child of parents who would soon have a fourth, my folks raised us on spacious farmland in an impressively small town named Ogden.
