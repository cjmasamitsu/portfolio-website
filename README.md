<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

After a few semesters at Johns Hopkins, I wanted a place to showcase my work. Given the importance of being able to demonstrate analyses and statistical findings easily, I decided it would be worthwhile to create and deploy my own website from scratch.

I started by reading a few Towards Data Science articles on Medium. I found a few recommendations for places to start and started working. 

<!-- What I Learned -->
## What I Learned 

Creating a website from scratch doesn't happen overnight. Styling languages like HTML and CSS are not my strongest languages, but I certainly grew those skills while creating my website. In addition, adding an SSL certificate, creating automatic deployments (on Heroku), and altering DNS records were all new skills I acquired.
